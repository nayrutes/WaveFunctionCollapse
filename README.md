My take on the Wave Function Collapse inspired by this blog post: https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/17/wavefunction-collapse-algorithm/

Size, rules, and specific tiles can be set.

The example is height 30 and width 60, with the left top and the right bottom as fixed values.

The output in the console:

Planned:
- parameterize the main function call to include size, seed, and maybe rules
- optimization
- multi-layer generation
- improved probability calculation
